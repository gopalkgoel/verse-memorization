    Now I am confused about my duty and have lost all composure because of
    miserly weakness. In this condition I am asking You to tell me for certain
    what is best for me. Now I am Your disciple, and a soul surrendered unto
    You. Please instruct me.

    satyaṁ diśaty arthitam arthito nṛṇāṁ
    naivārthado yat punar arthitā yataḥ
    svayaṁ vidhatte bhajatām anicchatām
    icchāpidhānaṁ nija-pāda-pallavam
  translation: >+
    The Supreme Personality of Godhead fulfills the material desires of a
    devotee who approaches Him with such motives, but He does not bestow
    benedictions upon the devotee that will cause him to demand more
    benedictions again. However, the Lord willingly gives the devotee shelter at
    His own lotus feet, even though such a person does not aspire for it, and
    that shelter satisfies all his desires. That is the Supreme Personality’s
    special mercy.
